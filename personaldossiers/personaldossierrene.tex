    \section{Improve quality management skills}
	\subsection{SMART learning goal}
	\begin{SMART}
	    \item[Specific] As a project quality manager in the GreenTechLab Software Factory, my goal is to increase my ability to identify and specify quality standards as well as to assure the quality and to control it.
	    \item[Measurable] Since I had issues with the quality management in my internship report, I will receive feedback from the other team members during the project using a questionnaire, as well as from the evaluation board at the end of this project. Furthermore I could get in touch with the customer to see if he was satisfied with the quality management.
	    \item[Attainable] Since we spoke about Quality Management in the second year course Business Management, I have several documents to rely on and to work from. Furthermore there is a bunch of documentation about this topic available on the internet.
	    \item[Relevant] Since we spoke about Quality Management in the second year course Business Management, I have several documents to rely on and to work from. Furthermore there is a bunch of documentation about this topic available on the internet.
	    \item[Time-limited]By January 2016, this project will be closed, therefore I will be able to manage the quality of a project until then.
	    \item[My complete goal] To improve my quality management by January 2016.
	\end{SMART}
	
	This requirement was drafted when we thought we were going to develop using web technology and not via xamarin. So the requirement has changed from web based development to normal software development. \\
	I choose this one, because as a software engineer it is always good to keep improving your software skills, especially in new environments. For me it was new to develop for multi platform, so there is a lot to learn.

	    \item[Measurable] I will receive feedback from the team members using a questionnaire. Furthermore I will receive feedback from our lecturer.
	    \item[Attainable] We will have several meetings with our customer, and as a project quality manager I will talk to the customer about some of the requirements and about some quality standards.

	\subsection{SMART learning goal}
	\begin{SMART}
	    \item[Specific] As a project quality manager in the GreenTechLab Software Factory, my goal is to improve my analytical competencies in new situations. Meaning that everytime a new situation occurs, it has to analyzed.
	    \item[Measurable] I will receive feedback from the team members using a questionnaire.
	    \item[Attainable] Since we are working within a scrum environment, it is possible that the requirements change completely or at least the prioritization, therefore I would have to react and to analyze the new situation.
