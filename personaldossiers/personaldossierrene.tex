    \section{Improve quality management skills}
	\subsection{SMART learning goal}
	\begin{SMART}
	    \item[Specific] As a project quality manager in the GreenTechLab Software Factory, my goal is to increase my ability to identify and specify quality standards as well as to assure the quality and to control it.
	    \item[Measurable] Since I had issues with the quality management in my internship report, I will receive feedback from the evaluation board at the end of this project. Furthermore I could get in touch with the customer to see if he was satisfied with the quality management.
	    \item[Attainable] Since we spoke about Quality Management in the second year course Business Management, I have several documents to rely on and to work from. Furthermore there is a bunch of documentation about this topic available on the internet.
	    \item[Relevant] In my future career, in which I want to become a project manager. As a project manager it is also important to know the quality management.
	    \item[Time-limited]By January 2016, this project will be closed, therefore I will be able to manage the quality of a project until then.
	    \item[My complete goal] To improve my quality management by January 2016.
	\end{SMART}
	
	%This requirement was drafted when we thought we were going to develop using web technology and not via xamarin. So the requirement has changed from web based development to normal software development. \\
	%I choose this one, because as a software engineer it is always good to keep improving your software skills, especially in new environments. For me it was new to develop for multi platform, so there is a lot to learn.
	
	\subsection{STARR Analysis}
	\begin{STARR}
	    \item[Situation] At the start of the project I was elected as the project quality manager.
	    \item[Task] My task was to make sure that everyone sticked to the quality standard which were set in the beginning of the project.
	    \item[Action] In the beginning of the project I started to set up several quality guidelines regarding documentation and coding conventions.
	    \item[Result] The result of my role as the quality manager of this project was a quality management plan which can be seen in chapter 4. The quality management plan defines the agreed quality standards. Furthermore it was stated how the group should be able to reach the targeted quality standards. One example is that a documentation template was created, so that every document which was created had the same overall layout, as well as a titlepage and a document information page. This Template can be found in chapter 15 section 43 of the group dossier.
	    \item[Reflection] I wanted to be quality manager because of the issues with the quality management in my internship report. Since there was a lack in quality management I decided to go for this role. The project started well, the standards were defined fast and everyone agreed with the quality management plan. But then during the project i recognized that there were issues with one of the defined standards. I told the group in each situation that we should write tests but the testing was only poorly done. Since I checked every implemented feature at least for it's GUI, I should've given the approval only if testing was done. This is something I would do different next time. But all in all I'd say I reached the targeted goal of increasing my quality management skills.
	\end{STARR}
	
	\section{Improve communication skills}
	\subsection{SMART learning goal}
	\begin{SMART}
	    \item[Specific] As a project quality manager in the GreenTechLab Software Factory, my goal is to increase my ability to speak to a customer more freely in english.
	    \item[Measurable] I will receive feedback from the team members using a questionnaire. Furthermore I will receive feedback from our lecturer.
	    \item[Attainable] We will have several meetings with our customer, and as a project quality manager I will talk to the customer about some of the requirements and about some quality standards.
	    \item[Relevant] In my future career, in which I want to become a project manager, speaking freely to customers is a core competence.
	    \item[Time-limited] By January 2016, this project will be closed, therefore I’ll have to higher my communication skills until then
	    \item[My complete goal] To improve my communication skills by January 2016.
	\end{SMART}
	
	\subsection{STARR Analysis}
	\begin{STARR}
	    \item[Situation] I was elected as the project quality manager, therefore i wanted to talk to the customer.
	    \item[Task] As the quality manager of TreeWatch I was supposed to talk to the customer about how we are going to produce a product of high quality.
	    \item[Action] During the meetings I talked to the customer about how the pair programming worked out and how we were able to achieve the quality the high quality the product has right now.
	    \item[Result] Since this goal is completely based on a b-competence i created a questionnaire which was filled out by the group twice. The first time in November and again in January.
	    The Questionnaire was simple and consisting only of two questions and both ranked from 1 to 5 (5 is the highest):
	    \begin{L2}
	    \item Does the QM talk to the customer?
	    \item How fluid would you say is his english when talking to the customer?
	    \end{L2}
	    The results shown in figure~\ref{lsqn}  and figure~\ref{lsqj} show that I improved my language skills.
	    \item[Reflection] This goal was really important for me, because even when the studies at Fontys are in english, I never had to talk to a real customer in english. Which means that i had to make use of the proper business english which I learned at Fontys.

	\section{Improve analytical skills}
	\subsection{SMART learning goal}
	\begin{SMART}
	    \item[Specific] As a project quality manager in the GreenTechLab Software Factory, my goal is to improve my analytical competencies in new situations. Meaning that everytime a new situation occurs, it has to be analyzed.
	    \item[Measurable] I will receive feedback from the team members using a questionnaire.
	    \item[Attainable] Since we are working within a scrum environment, it is possible that the requirements change completely or at least the prioritization, therefore I would have to react and to analyze the new situation.
	    \item[Relevant] In my future career, in which I want to become a project manager, good analytical competencies are necessary to be successful.
	    \item[Time-limited] By January 2016, this project will be closed, therefore I’ll have to higher my analytical competencies by then.
	    \item[My complete goal] To improve my analytical competencies by January 2016.
	\end{SMART}
	
	\subsection{STARR Analysis}
	\begin{STARR}
	    \item[Situation] I was elected as the project quality manager and therefore I was responsible to deal with quality management related issues.
	    \item[Task] Analyze new situations e.g. a change in requirements.
	    \item[Action] Since the project ran very smooth and there were no changes in the requirements or the prioritization, I wasn't able to analyze situations like that, but during the project I was able to develop several features myself. And due to pair programming I was able to increase my analytical skills in coding.
	    \item[Result] During the implementation of the application I was able to implement several features. I implemented the SQLite implementeation which you can see in chapter 15 section 26 and as a sample implementation of a many-to-many relationship in chapter 15 sections 27 and 28. Section 27 shows the BlockToDo class which was needed to have a clean normalized implementation of the database and in section 28 you can see how the table in between is used. Chapter 15 section 29 shows the implementation of a model which has a position, but instead of saving latitude and longitude as two values, the position is stored as a blob which represents a serialized string and SQLite is able to deserialize it back to the original type of 'Position'. Furthermore I worked together with Jan Kerkenhoff on the implementation of a KML-Parser (Chapter 15 section 42) which is able to read real data which we got from the customer, into the created SQLite database. Another feature which was implemented using pair programming with Jan Kerkenhoff was the FieldMapRenderer (chapter 15 section 36 and 38). This FieldMapRenderer was needed to show the fields on the map. During the project the FieldMapRenderer got an update and was then able to also show Overlays like Blocks or Heatmap. Where the map and the overlays were implemented for Android and iOS platform specific, was the heatmap only implemented on iOS since we encountered big performance issues.
	    \item[Reflection] I wasn't able to fulfill my goal to improve the situation analysis competence but I was able to make a big step with my coding analysis competence which is also very helpful. Furthermore I was able to see the benefits of pair programming especially when a Software Engineering student develops together with a Business Informatics student. The different way of thinking led us to solutions earlier and we were able to implement features faster and cleaner then without pair programming.
