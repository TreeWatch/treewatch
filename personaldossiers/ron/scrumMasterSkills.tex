\section{Improve Skills of a Scrum Master}
	\subsection{Reason to Choose}
		In the project during the 7th semester, which is the Software Factory, I chose the position of a Scrum Master. To successfully fill in this position and being able to support my group I wanted to improve my knowledge of this position during that semester.
		My decision was made for the following learning goal because of this reason.

	\subsection{S.M.A.R.T.}
	\begin{SMART}
	    \item[Specific] As the Scrum Master in our project, I want to improve my skills for this task.
	    \item[Measurable] This competence can be measured using a small questionnaire, because my team members can tell the best if I have made myself well.
	    \item[Attainable] To improve my skills in this area, I can find lots of information on the Internet but also benefit from the experience of my group.
	    \item[Relevant] Scrum is a methodology in many software projects of small and large companies.
	    \item[Time-limited] The semester ends in January 2016 which is why I will have reached my goal by the end of January.
	\end{SMART}
