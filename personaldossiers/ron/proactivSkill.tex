\section{Improve a Proactive}
	\subsection{Reason to Choose}
		Since I go to school for my appointments my biggest problem is to be on time. Therefore, this objective is one of my most important, because of this I would like to improve.
	
	\subsection{S.M.A.R.T.}
		\begin{SMART}
		    \item[Specific] A proactive for me is to be present and on time. That's one of my biggest weaknesses.
		    \item[Measurable] This can be measured by a statistical comparison of the times when I was on time and unpunctual. In addition, you can compare my arrival and absent-ness percentage together.
		    \item[Attainable] In the present time appointments, work schedules and events are an integral part and therefore time management is a very important issue.
		    \item[Relevant] This is a very relevant issue, as it could cost me my job if I am too often absent or late.
		    \item[Time-limited] The semester ends in January 2016 which is why I will have reached my goal by the end of January.
		\end{SMART}
