\subsection{Problem description}
The main problem of Fleuren is that they started to notice that the quality of some fruit trees decreased due to human error. For instance  one block of trees would get sprayed twice because something went wrong when registering which blocks have been sprayed. This is an unnecessary waste of resources.

An other problem Fleuren that has is that there is no clear overview of what happens when they change one of the steps within the production process. Therefore it is hard to improve the production and make decisions which affect long term production.
