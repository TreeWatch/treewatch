\section{Risks}
The following table contains the biggest risks the project will be facing. The severity and probability are defined for every known risk. These are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 having the lowest severity and 5 the highest. Also an action is defined which will be executed when a problem occurs. if the severity and probability are multiplied a multiplier is calculated. This multiplier helps determine which risks pose the most danger to the project.
