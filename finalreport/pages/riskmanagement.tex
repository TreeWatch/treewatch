\subsection{Risk}
The following table contains the biggest risks the project will be facing. The severity and probability are defined for every known risk. These are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 having the lowest severity and 5 the highest. Also an action is defined which will be executed when a problem occurs. if the severity and probability are multiplied a multiplier is calculated. This multiplier helps determine which risks pose the most danger to the project.

\begin{longtable}{ c p{3cm} c c c p{4cm} }
	ID & Risk & Severity & Probability & Multiplier & Action \\ \hline
	1 & Possible conflict of interest  & 4 & 4 & 16 & Speak to involved parties to clear the problem and define direction of the project. \\
	2 & Xamarin licenses not available & 2 & 4 & 8 & Develop natively for both apps. \\
