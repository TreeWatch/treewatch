\section{Conclusion}
The TreeWatch app has come a long way but still has a long way to go. A lot of the basic functionality has been implemented. The app can already be used to visualize where all the fields are located on the map and is also able to show overlays such as the block data and biomass.

VAA ICT Consultancy will need to continue the development of the app in order to make it practically usable. This means that a web based database needs to be added which contains all the info. For now the information about the fields is still stored locally on the device. Furthermore also the history and todo parts of the app should be implemented.

All in all the customer was very satisfied with the product we delivered at the end of the project. During the meeting that marked the end of the implementation period we even received applause from the customer. He said that in the beginning he was skeptical about what students could achieve in a half year time period, but that we removed every doubt he had and exceeded all expectations.
