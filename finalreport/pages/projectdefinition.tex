\section {Project definition}
Fleuren has given the SoFa TreeWatch group the assignment to create a multi-platform app. The app should provide Fleuren with insight in what has been done to their fields and should give an overview of what still needs to be done to the fields. Using the app Fleuren should then also be able to make long term decisions based on the data shown. For instance when a certain field produces fruit trees of better quality it should be possible to look into the history of that field and compare that history to the history of a field which has produced lower quality trees. By looking at the differences Fleuren should be able to spot patterns in how to improve the quality of its trees.

TreeWatch project group will work on the project for 5 months. During this time the TreeWatch project group will try to fulfill as much requirements as possible. After the 5 month period VAA ICT Consultancy will take over and finish the project. The take over means that it will be important for the TreeWatch project group to properly document all the code.
