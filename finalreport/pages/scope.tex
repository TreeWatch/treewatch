\section{Scope}
This section is about what is in scope of this project and what needs to be done afterwards by the VAA ICT Consultancy after they took over the project.
\subsection{In Scope}
This document is about analysis, design and implementation of a functional prototype of a mobile App running on iOS and Android. 
\subsection{Out of Scope}
Not inside of the scope is anything which is needed to provide the App with data from external sources. This means servers or webservices are not created during this project.
