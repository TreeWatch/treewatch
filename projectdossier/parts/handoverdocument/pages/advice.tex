\section{Advice}
Because of performance issues that occur when the app has to calculate the overlays of the fields and the blocks, it is recommended that the server should draw all the polygons and then send it as an image to the phone. Then the phone should be able to overlay this image on the correct position. This would greatly improve the speed of the app.
