\section{Introduction}
This document is about a project called Software Factory which has to be done during the 7th semester at Fontys University of Applied Science Venlo. The project brings Software Engineering and Business Informatics Students together to develop a solution for a real customer. In this case the customer is called Fleuren. 

One goal of this project is to let the students act as the SoFa was their own company. This means the group works independent from the lecturers. Only the process coach keeps track of what the students do. In meetings which where scheduled on a weekly base, the process coach got information about the current status and if there were any problems. 

\subsection{The Customer}
Fleuren is a tree nursery using high precision farming to grow fruit trees. After two or three years, depending on the variety, the trees are sold to companies which then harvest the fruits. Precision farming, in case of Fleuren, means that the trees are planted automatically by a tractor in rows of six trees of the same kind, this is then called a block.
