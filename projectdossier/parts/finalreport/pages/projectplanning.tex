\subsection{Projectplanning}

As shown in in figure~\ref{fig:GanttchartMilestones} the SoFa group had 20 weeks of working time, it was planned that one sprint is two weeks long. Furthermore it was planned that the analysis would take two sprints in which the project was set up, the user stories were defined and prioritised. The design phase was the planned to take only one sprint, since after a first design the group was able to start implementing anyways even if there were changes to the \gls{gui}.
The implementation, which was the main part of the project was planned to take six sprints and the documenting should take one sprint.
