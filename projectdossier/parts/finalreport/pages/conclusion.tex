\section{Conclusion}
The TreeWatch app has come a long way but still has a long way to go. A lot of the basic functionality has been implemented. The app can already be used to visualize where all the fields are located on the map and is also able to show overlays such as the block data and biomass.

VAA ICT Consultancy will need to continue the development of the app in order to make it practically usable. This means that a web based database needs to be added which contains all the info. For now the information about the fields is still stored locally on the device. Furthermore also the history and todo parts of the app should be implemented.
